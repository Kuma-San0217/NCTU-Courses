Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

Hold up, bitches simmer down
Takin' hella long, bitch, give it to me now
Make that thing pop like a semi or a 9
Ooh, baby like it raw with the shimmy shimmy ya
Huh, A$AP, get like me
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome, make you sweat like Keith
‘Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, like how you figure?
Gettin' figures and fuckin' bitches
She rollin' Swishers, brought her bitches
I brought my niggas, they gettin' bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act niggerish
But least a nigga nigga rich
I be fuckin' broads like I be fuckin' bored
Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fuckin' boys; beast

Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on
Oh word? Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… (Okay, I got it)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast

Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Aye, y'all—duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what!

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (soldier’s DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that’s a riff, gon' plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish?
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies”
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin'
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid, then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that "Juicy" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

Throw a steak off the ark
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again — oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S.

I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S.

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S.

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bust a rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C. and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!" – that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You're rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop," – 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk – so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for (Satan); it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard – be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the

Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-five, and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it!"
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so

It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this."
Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: "Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off

Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
You didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous ‘cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word — I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together — think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep
And you scream about it; I hope your conscience eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See, Slim— shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news
A couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was… it was you, damn

I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
(Hey!) There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me and my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail Mary, nigga!

They got a APB out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that mothafucka, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond; when I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
"Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!"
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
"It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
"I gotta get paid!" — well hey, but that's the way it is

And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat," that's the way it is

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it," because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, ho!"
Equipped with money in a Benz ‘cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, ‘cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous ‘cause deep in the heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride I was the first off this side, give me the 9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
(That's all you niggas got?!)
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops ‘cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck buck buck buck buck!)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', "Thug 'til I die!" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm so we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!

Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on

I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screamin', "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me

The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me

First off, fuck yo' bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. is some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (ha ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo', pass the MAC
And let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer
And I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power
Tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour
I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle, all you niggas gettin' killed
With your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy — why you fuckin' with me?
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!

I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And colder from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up

I'm like "Bitch, who is your mans?" ayy
Can't keep my dick in my pants, ayy
My bitch don't love me no mo', ayy
She kick me out, I'm like vro, ayy
That bitch don't wanna be friends, ayy
I gave her dick, she amen, ayy
She put her tongue on my dick, ayy
Look at my wrist, about ten, ayy
Just got a pound of the boof, ayy
Brought that shit straight to the booth, ayy
Tommy my Hilfiger voots, ayy
She said, "wan' fuck?" Bitch, I do, ayy
You put a gun on my mans, ayy
I put a hole in your parents, ayy
I just got lean on my ksubis, ayy
I got a UZI, no Uzi

I took a white bitch to Starbucks
That little bitch got her throat fucked
I like to rock out like I'm misfit
My emo bitch like her wrist slit
Curly hair bitch like I'm Corbin
Got, like, three bitches, I'm Mormon
Skeet on your main bitch's forehead
Don't want your pussy, just want head

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contentious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love when you're around
But I fuckin' hate when you leave

I'm nauseous, I'm dyin'
She ripped my heart right out
Can't find her, someone to—
My eyes are all cried out
Lost it, riots
Gunfire inside my head
I've lost it, riots
Gunfire inside my head

I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

Only time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love
That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time I'm in my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic, traffic

Baby, that's blasphemy, yeah
Baby, you're bad for me, yeah
Say you gon' clap for me, yeah
Say you gon' blast for me, yeah
Why you ain't show me none of the love you say you have for me, yeah
I was goin' through tragedy
Bitch, I needed you drastically, yeah
I'ma just switch my flow up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no throw up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no check up, yeah
Boy, you need to run your check up, yeah
I'm eatin' on you niggas, no ketchup, yeah
I'm eatin' on you niggas, can't catch up, ayy
Hit her face down with her ass up, ayy

And if the world ever has an apocalypse
I will kill all of you fuckers
Fear will be plentiful, death will be bountiful
I will spare none of you peasants
Fuck your religion, your pastor fucked kids
And got sent to a prison in PC
I seen the devil, he’s in you and me
You need saving to listen to this, see
Follow 'em home, cut the right corner so nobody sees you
Turn off your phone
Leave it at home so nobody can trace you
Mask your expressions
Appear to be calm, they won't read your intentions
As soon as you’re in
Let them all know who they’re all in the presence of
I am a murderer
I am a demon, the son of a serpent
What is your faith?
What is your worth?
Have you felt acknowledgment?
If I kill you now, will you go to heaven or hell you believe in?
Death is approaching you
30 seconds think before lying in blood, see

And I'm always where the sun don't shine
The tears don't show, won't hurt me now 'cause
Heart's been broke, I hate myself, but
It won't show, I constantly lose all
My remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who
Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer now I'm trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace
Where is this going? Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's
War with the pacifist to word of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, my Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I gave him one thing you needed
"What is this thing?", I pleaded; boy, it's the key to even, yeah

'Cause you know that I'm fly-y-y
Fly boy, they call me
Let's turn you and I to we (fresh ting)
She said "boy, you're silly"
Then ran for her bus quickly
No oyster, I didn't chase it (never chase)
I just jumped in the whip and I paced it (skrrt)

Skidi-ah-pa-coo-too-coo-boom (coo-too-coo)
Skidi-ki, a-toom-toom (poom-poom)
Brother, push back (push back)
Oh, that's your girl? Her wig's wack (take it off)
Then she started movin' shy (movin' shy)
I'll take you to Dubai (to Dubai)
We'll eat breakfast in the sky (Burj Khalifa)
Tell them other man bye (bye)
Tell 'em bye-bye, she gave me side-eye
Listen, babes, I'm actually a nice guy (I'm a nice guy)
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good try
But if I text you, are you goin' to reply?
You might decline, then I rewind
But you stay there, 'cause it's all fine

Drink 'nough beers before the game, what d'ya call that? Georgie Best MC
Listen, I don't rest MC
You man sleep, that's why you're not the best MC
You man are part time, never had beef
But you're on the mic like a bulletproof vest MC
I'm a double, precious, tek MC
Separate heads from necks-
I was in the shadows, I came to the light with a path
Us spitters who wanna be first and never be last
I've been ahead of the game, I've been ahead of the craft
I wanna laugh
Come sailin' along like a boss
With the flow I'm like rah, what the ras?
I'm a striker, yo where the pass? Get my triple A passes
I'm sittin' with the stars
Listen up, I ain't normal, I'm sicker than my bars
Driven myself crazy, I've been in every car
Now I like to fly by on my black Yamaha, that's wingin'
Some man do the crime and talk but that's singin'
Not many man have been in the wars that I've been in
I can work here but it's not a place that I could live in
Gettin' new money though but I've already made a killin'
I've already made a scene, I already live a dream
And the king's road's lonely, you can't go with him
When it's time for a test
Man ah man have gotta move swiftly 'cause you don't want a knife in your chest
In the hood every day, it's heroin, livin' like they're dead
Made it, now you're lyin' in your bed
It's like, "Yo, has anybody seen my flow right here, cuz?"
Live in your ears like earplugs
Keep myself away like rare dubs
What makes you so scared? I'm sure fear does
On the real though, I stand up and face it
The levels high in my scene, that's why I embrace it
Let me go on and enjoy what I created
Man will jump on the stage and go ape shit
For years I've been killin' it, trust me
Swear down, I will never get rusty
My lyrics dem will rough up your lyrics like rugby
For the work I put in, the fans love me

This one ain't free but it's the liberty
Street divinity
Me and Will's tyranny
And this one's willin' me to rise like Pyrenees peaks and I'm lyrically
In the sky and then I'm ridin' through infinity
Forever after, Devs be the master
Hit 'em with the Corleone ting, Godfather of grime
Don't charter to ride through parts of
This precinct when it gets darker
Don't think you can stand the heat
You can't stand this peak
I'm like a million and one lightyears way past of an artist's reach
Mary, I'm hard to beat
Now think deep
About this collabo
Historical events unravel
Like I went Middlesex, I came to Harrow
My man said he feel paro
Bloody cuffs, heart on my sleeve
This shit feels like beef to me
When I spit and my arms start swinigin', I'm bringin'
More raw shit than a Beckton works
Smell it and know why Kano writ it
Wrote it, fuck me, alright, don't quote it
Focus, look, now I'm back and it's hopeless
Comparin' me with these seeds
Too rare a breed of MC and the flow shifts
More than once a minute
Gettin' off like Dahmer, I come and I kill it
A Dagenham'er strapped with a bunch of lyrics
That bang harder, where the fuck's the gimmicks?
There ain't nada
I've got the heart and spirit they can't harbor
Silly men pass the limit and then scarper
When it comes on top with the urban legend, I get 'em like Carter

Spitters can't better these levels of terror
I leave my brain in my car but my head is together
I make a team of dons quit when I'm put under pressure
Rate Devlin, why? He's a grime treasure
In grime, I've lined my catalogue up, prime seller
I'm never too far from the hype that I set up
I step up like a bredda who's livin' in nice weather
At work, puttin' words together with ice letters
I spray, make a big tree lean in the road
Trees drop on your house to leave them a cold
Trees drop on your car, the windows smash
Eski brought O2 Indigo back
But this whole time, fam, I've been holy in grime
Even a first time who don't know me in grime
But you love my stage vibe when I'm holdin' a mic
I'm a pro now, bro, I jump over the spike

Any hardcore fan of grime
Go mad when you hear this bang inside
I got the keys like pianists, black and white
I've been a beast in the scene all my adult life
Ever since Will said, "Hello, hi"
I was sat in the shadows, high
Concoctin' the maddest vibe
With a way less narrow sight
Than a homo sapien eye
X-Ray, make way for my death ray
Nikola Tesla reborn to a next stage
Technology stole our children
The world's in debt and our men are all templates
I'll bring ten crates of my best mates
Puttin' up my worst and best traits
Converse in a verse with dead saints
Holy grime, it's a blessed day

I said you need 3 man I don't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
I qualified for everything, long straight season
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it

You need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall
Like autumn, check my post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
But now the clock's aviated
Everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
Cause I get respected
While they get detested
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a line

I’m a reptile, been left wild with the next style
I spray projectiles that dead men within ten miles
For a bit I’m pensive then I vent vile, lyrics and phlegm bile
I’m sex smiles, this ex-child was born in a red nile
Sex wild, girls on my left and right arm, make Devs hard
But after the foul play, I’m showin' them a red card like Prem stars
Engrave this seat, I’m leavin' a benchmark
And hench scars on popular idols with these death stars

I’m an ex-guy with ten pints of red stripe
With feds at a red lights, on a dead night, with my revs high
Thank God, they sped by when he clocked eyes on the next ride
If they saw what’s lyin' inside my boot, I’m sure I’d get time
I react like an enzyme and defend guys like a mum cuss
I came from the bread line to the big time, I ain’t done trust
I’m tight like a nun’s muff and I make these punks jump
Like they just heard guns dump, I'ma just do me, don’t need no thumbs up

You want raw Devs?
I’ll drag you back inside of your mum with rusty forceps
I love packin' big but wanna be big before death
So big I circle the globe in four steps
You can’t spin me, get left in an infinite vortex
I’m more vexed, men don’t dress like men no more
Girls want rat like their out for the war
Act like a man, get banged in the jaw
I’m that sure
Whoever controls us from their platforms is bad for
Everyone of us
So I just spaz more

TV just lies, they just manipulate the truth
What you need to understand is the Government runs the news
So is it true XXXX fathered a baby?
I don’t really think so, if you ask me he don’t like ladies
Could have been Harry, yeah, I bet it was Harry
Fingered a Gary, filled her with Harry
And let XXX marry
I still be the baddy
Think I’m clean, I’ll kill Kim and Aggie
Murder the pally
Little brown-nosed kids in a random rally
Yeah it’s Daggie

Time to get that profit all in
Won't rest 'til all my niggas rocket ballin'
I don't even think I stopped this mornin'
I'm that nigga that usually gets them what's-it-calleds in
I'm caught, when it's time to get that shoppin' sorted
Oh, this Armani blazer, bitch I got imported
Yeah I like that whip
Because I'm on the bands, only reason I ain't dropped that forty
Hot chicks see me on the streets and they stop and call me
Want me to get my willy out so they can toss it for me
Got 'em goin' topless for me
When she pop it for me, really got me horny
Record label contract, my lawyers got it for me
Dotted all the I's and the T's, can you cross 'em for me?
You can try and put your crosses on me
I don't watch hate, I got shooters that'll watch it for me

I'm heavy, I'm colder
Better me? No sir
I could tear apart MC's, but I'd rather read
A book on childcare by Kerry Katona
No niceness, I ran out of it, dumb it down a bit
Ain't somethin' I'm prepared to do
Well I ain't ever gonna run out of lip
Here's somethin' I prepared for you
I tried to relax
But being spaced it inspires me back
When will I be nice to Katie Price?
The day I see a cage fighter in drag, ah
I don't want a tomorrow without friction
Jump into beef both feet first
And make pros eat their words
And sit and watch 'em swallow their own dic-tion

Uh, iSHi distort that bass
Man grew up on a raw estate
Now, everytime I draw my dates
They're like "How the fuck d'you afford this place?"
First place, first place, first place
Try act up, dem man will address that, call it
Put a fuckin' man in his place
Bitch I'm great, for goodness sake
I ain't gotta queue cause they know my face
Girls took my watch tryin' to wind up on me
I was like I ain't got time to waste, get it?
I ain't got time to waste, get it?
Try and get hype in my face, regret it
Got a big pitbull and I don't remember
The last time I fed it, so don't upset it

Let me grieve for the beat before I murder it
Don't know my name? By now you should've heard of it
Why, cause I'm murderin' anybody lurking in
Close proximity, circlin'
Will make an example of men when I stride in
Dev's has got a tiny temper
I'm observing this, learning
But now I'm just yearning to burn it, I'll fire your agenda
Lock me up, might high risk offender
Make a man turn on his own team like an Irish defender
I'm a rhymin' inventor that's climbin' up heights you're not meant to
The game's over, so roll over
I'm sober, but I'll still kidnap a so called soldier
And bolt in the Rover to Dover
Yeah it's over, the game's over

Put up your lighters, I clash the Titans
Fight the fighters, Mike fight the biters
Spit till my throat got tonsillitis
That's on a Monday mornin', ha
Takin' over, run straight past ya
No warnin', a real disaster
Harder, faster, stronger, longer
This one here was top of the classroom
Stop the lecture, drop the pressure
Never say never, but nevertheless I
Never say no to experiments
Whether it's tenements, clubs, yards, spittin' with eloquence
Positive sentiments
Havin' a hell of a time and it's evident
Don't question my relevance
I've started on this so I'm back in my element

Uh, I open my mouth, niggas panic
The jewels are liabilities, mmm, I'm the asset
Underdogs are barkin' up, shh hush puppy
My new chain's got red and blue ice man
I call it my slush puppy
Yeah, let me clap 'em with the reminder flow
I was best newcomer, err, time ago
Yeah, you've all passed your sell by date to me
I'm different nigga, I sell out
When you add a venue and date to me

They better let me go, let me loose
I'm frozen cold, my veins are blue
Hell to home, but it's Satan proof
Good as gold, my angels flew
Yo, they can't knock down mine
Cuffs on flows I lock down lines
I am not human, real life mutant
Ask Mick Foley, I'm not mankind
Yeah, look under my eyelids
All red, I bleed through the iris
Like I've been toking on weed, highest
Now my brain's on freeze, minus
Yeah I ain't letting it melt
I'm stark, haze, I'm letting it fill
Sideline this now separate that
I'm stayin here I ain't lettin' it gel, ill

I think that I'm gonna be sick
It seems like every MC is about
Loves tellin' the poor they're rich
Then they wonder why they're gettin' rolled on
When they wanna try and walk round in the bits
This is real life, no thrills hype
On a reals, it feels like
I've been impaled on a steel spike
But still fight, for my girls and real guys in the real grind that write real rhymes
It's the boy next door that kicked down doors and I'm back on an ill vibe
(Alright)
Twenty pounds on my weed
Five pounds for my pint
No swagger at all, just me
And I bet I can draw your wife
Comply with anythin' please
I'm gutter, I'll do what I like
I had a pipe dream in the grime scene
Now I'm flyin' at withering heights

Ten pounds for my cab
Some cheap wine for this skank
I'm streetwise, you ain't, fact
I'll fleece guys, you're gettin' wrapped
Outside of the East Side is where I'm at
Where fiends lie and make traps
For these sweet guys that flash
But when it's beats time, it ain't that
(Alright)
These times, I'm in the lab with Terms
These guys are on a madness learn
No peace signs, I'm gonna stab this verse
Just to kill it, I'm able and willin'
Rep for the boys, and the kids and the women
Tryna get by in the times that we live in
Tryna make a life and a livin'

I never had it, made it, saved it
Spent it, lost it, gave it
To people who needed it more than me
Guys in the ends getting shanked for the P
More time, I'm tryna show man the vision
But it's like man are still too poor to see
So I let man do their ting
I ain't judgin' anybody, I don't want a law degree
You see the rap lifestyle, and you wanna live it
Celebrities and their worthless riches
I ain't sayin' I don't want to make money
But right now, I'm tryna do the right tings with it
If I eat food, eat food in my crew
See me and Dev in a cinema near you
And when I pull up to the premiere
Don't ask why I ain't wearin' a suit, you're tired

I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You’d find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I’m still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black, it’s too cold
I’m all alone take me back to the roads
I had to roam to get here and I’ll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother’s house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What’s a brother for?
When I’m sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears, full of war
I was a plowman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs

Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though
That’s why they live a lie
I don’t think I’ll ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother’s at my side
There’s no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You’ve seen mine, I think it’s time I see yours
I bet you that we’ve been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I’m trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics

Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain’t religious I’m a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I’ve been a joker, I’ve been a thief, I’ve been a rapper
I’ve been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter

They call me young gun like I was a pistol in the primary
Speaking codes no binary
Irony, is that I don’t have a beautiful mind at all
I’m not tired at all
There’s no time to pause
Deep thought, with my feet sore from walking
Not a lot of money for a cheap Porsche
Though I don’t drive but I’m known by the guys
That are designed to make you go hype
Like Devlin & Grim with the chilling, chilling
Bring Yasmin for the singing, killing
And I’m keeping the melody where it better be
I’m deadly and readily burning within the evergreen of enemies
Higher than a feather with Amphetamines
Only my head top could be ahead of me
Voice hoarse but guess what? It’s never Ketamine
Making noise from Brent Cross
Head in the hedge tops
Giving up my soul again for the guest spot
Four young guns in London
When we’re coming up

Yeah, me and Devlin young gunning
Skunk bunning, delete you with one button
If you don't know somebody best tell them
I turn their head red like Ed Sheeran
I already went heaven, let's get them
I'll better them in 10 seconds
Since I got a holla back like Gwen Steffans
Follow that because I'm trend setting
(?) you get better instead of gettin' the message
I put in less of the effort
I'm still better than most
Come around try bread, all you'll be getting is toast
I've been ten out of ten from eleven years old
but I left him alone
I'm back for the title like I'm living at home
See me at the O2, no gas ting(?)
Know that I'm coming up next like Yasmin

Young guns
I’m a young gun like a brand new weapon
I'm outstanding (?) and tell them what I reckon
To be a part of the arsenal present
You'd have to be better than Devlin, Yasmin, Griminal and Edders
So in that case forget it
If you don't make the cut like a radio edit
You'll get left beheaded then deaded
When Devs takes you out like a direct debit
One, I runaway for a minute of two
But now I'm back in the booth
I got ‘em all pissed like I poured Cognac on the tune
I ain't nobody's sun cause I stand on the moon
Young guns full of class A lines that'll heighten your mood (?)
Like chasin’ spirals with a spoon
You're not safe like a baby inside of the womb
Every time we arrive in the room

I think you forget that Jim’s been a threat and a vet
So long so where's the respect?
You ain't repped with DJ Slimzee on set
I ain't heard you on a tape or cassette
Cause weren't present when grime weren't pleasant
A game full of shottas and goons and peasants
Rascal run away with the scene
Man on par with the stickiest lemon
The mic in my hands like a stick to a felon
Letting off rhymes my mouth is my weapon
Blowing up south, Peckham to Streatham
Blowing up west from Acton to Shepherds
And my name spread north of course
Tottenham to Angel I rock the cradle
And I been running round east from day
Dagenham to Barking, Hackney to Cable Street
With a lyrically shot speed
Every man from a manor where the blocks deep
Where your block's like an episode of Dawson's Creek
Rest in peace to the Esco
Let's go, anyone who built this scene
I'm taking it back to an old school theme
I'm oceans deep and they flow too weak
Side with me and fly like a frisbee
Go against me and die like Da Vinci
I open the pages and write in the history
I'm right in the middle of my life it's a mystery
I wound up on an Island with Tinchy
A label Marley made famous
See a minor, that's why I'm major
Shut one eye then stare at my wallet
You still won't ever see half of my paper
Life's a ride how far it will take ya
Depends how far that you'll break ya
Back to make ya stack bigger than a freight container
More cash more money in the bank
Till I die and reside with the maker
I'll shoot for the hoop like I was a Laker
You said white boys can't jump you're a hater
I'll jump all over your boat race then shout later
I'm the administrator for pain inside of a chamber
Full of nightmares I don't fight fair
If I wanna find breh's I don’t use no satellite navigator
Cause the word on the street is that your in town with your bird on the weekend
What's the odds that we just might meet then?
When I run up on you like an east end weed den

You show me the conditions, hear the terms of my recital
Murmur and I'll murder you so bring the German rifles
I'm rolling with the Kalashnikov I'm backing off my rivals
Call me (censored) I’ll kill you off like (censored)
And naa I ain't acting I'm as practically a spiteful
As going back in time to give the atom bomb to Guy Fawkes
Now I'm stuck and I’m waiting for a time warp
To once again return you can’t terminate a cyborg
I'm made of metal, I could break you all like ply board
Broke the ground level, now like Luke, I like to sky-walk
I'm a dying rebel like Gaddafi not compliable
I'll stab you with a paint brush, there's art in my survival
I'm like a cyclops with the all seeing eyeball
And all I see is weed to think it's time to build an ital
Burn you to degrees that your skeleton is frightful
After they discover you in my ash tray after nightfall
I kept it real but all they seem to want is fake
I should speak like a wanker and spit bars like Drake
Fishing hook aaahhh bait, I'll come to your estate
And slap your mates who insisted that you was great
And then I'll take your style and your charisma
Combine em with tobacco and ignite em in a Rizla
You left me in my lane we all tried to play the game
So now you need to ascertain that I could flip you like your sister
But no homo just poisoning the promo
Charlie ain't a sloth naa he's a yeti in a polo
And Devlin I'm a dragon reigning fire on your postcode
I hold gold so let me throw a blow and leave your nose broke
Like Britannia it's black and white like a panda
The devils levels higher looking down from my veranda
And so that you know what you hold is false hope
And false goals don't account for much when the truths told
Sorry for the flames I induce this is murder
Blame put the name on my crew this is murder
Jimmy I'm an Essex boy so you know it's murder
Greater London in between the city and suburbia
Hold tight Klash and Terra Firma, it's murder
D-E-V-L-I-N, yeah you know it's murder
Charlie Sloth the DJ that you all hearda' it’s murder
D-E-V-L-I-N, murder

It's OT crew in the house again
We been endowed with the strength of a thousand men
I live a long dream make a biro bleed
Turn a ball point into a fountain pen
When I spew red rivers I'm deading you
Getting you coming for your revenue too
You ain't never dwelt in the places I've been
I'm at home in the dark like Nosferatu
Or king Tut locked up in his tomb
For too many suns and too many moons
Whites and blacks who thrive to attack
Dagenham scums inside of the room
So there might quite be violence soon
Hear the sirens sound like Rascal and shoot
Then boot to the closest district tube
Big up Wiley he always knew
That I'd be a beast and a brute
And pollute the peace in the booth
Like pumping the sea fulla' crude oil
When I get deeper I’m rude
So the better I get you're all screwed
Am I a veteran? Yes you'll get moved
Weren't pulling your legs when I said I was a threat
I’m ill but will punch you out of ya shoes
English bomb with an Irish fuse
And there’s not long left till I detonate
Leave guys in a two and eight in a right old state
You better have your giro saved
I'm claiming anything I like ok
Cause I've found my groove and a ride
That keeps me amused this life is a game
I'm old school like fruit of the loom
But I come brand new so the youth can relate
And maybe try following the lead
My whole damn scene came outta the street
With young men letting off shots
And kids getting killed by the rocks like Apollo 18
I gotta swim through a sea fulla darkness
In a blackpool like Holloway's team
Forgive me if I take you for ransom
Naa I'm like Manson I got a regime
And I love bad vibes
In fact, I like it when everybody climbs on my back
When the knifes at the ready and they try to attack
But my names not Caesar–
And who gave yous the right to react?
To put your wife on her back like Caroline Flack
I ain't never been killed inside of the scene
Red rum backwards analyse that
Stun gun a pussy I paralyze cats
Don't sell drugs but I've got white raps
I'm a messed up geezer I just might snap
Not a wife beater but you might find me in Dags on a Friday
Bare knuckle fighting a slag and might have a fight with her dad
That's how it is cause my manors quite mad
And the spotlight coulda' never changed this man
God damn, that's who I am

It's like there's no love in the ends
And I feel like I need to provide for my friends
But I hate when I see my boys both guys bleeding
Light in the dark for my boys that I'm leading
I'm leading away to the better days
Where there's choong zoots, choong girls everyday
And no-one has to hustle in any way
So the bad memories, fold them away
But it hurts when my boys mum die
I bleed when you bleed, I cry when you cry
Still see my nans face late of a night
That will never change she's a part of my life
And when I move on, finally meet fate
I will search for the life for a sweet face
She'll embrace me into her arms
And tell me how to live life in the next place
Confused in this life that I lead
On the street, try not to get a knife in the spline
Lately there's a lot of hype on the scene
That you got to be a killer to be a MC
Naa, but I don't wanna hurt anybody
Kill anybody, wanna merk anybody
Driving out to the forest, start burying bodies
Naa mate that's not in my nature
But I swear down these streets will take you
Engage you in activities that are major
And I won't beat down for this shit
But I'm living in narm so I'm made to
I swear down follow me I'm out for the paper
The whole war thing? I'm not really on that
But I can only can take so much before I'm forced to engage in the sequence of combat
But it's not like back in the day where you could swing it out with a man and it's over
Cause nowadays man will come back round the bits with a samurai sword or a revolver
Yeah everybody wants to get physical
Business on the road is criminal
And I tried it and I didn't mind it
But lately, most of my business is lyrical
And everyday there's another beef
There's another little argument
Another little cheef
Loosing countless hours of sleep
And I'm stick, don't know how to receive
And I'm trying to stay strong but I'm still young
In the land where mums get left without sons
Don't know what to say I'm speechless for words that everyday shit of the slums

Everyday
Hol' tight my boys
Got love for you all
It's real

Yeah I smoke weed to escape
Cause every other day that I live in this world
I tempt fate in this place full of hate
But what keeps me going is my boys like Bramy and Paige, the strongest people
Our love ones never die they're the white dogs of the church steeple
This world is evil, and my boys can't get a job so they do shit that's illegal
No one plays fair, and no one gives a fuck everybody just wants to get paid here
No one plays here, and getting out of this shit is the vision that I stay clear
Because I'm dreaming and drifting the weight off my shoulder
I'm lifting rejected by God at my christening
Now it's time to speak out, because I feel that I've done enough listening
And when we pass on to another land, we all leave footprints in the sand
But when your in your coffin and you bodies rotten
You don't really want your personality forgotten (Never that)
I wanna' be cemented in time
Me and my boys everyday in the grind
Everyday another enemy I seem to find
But nobody is ahead of me in the space of time
And you know what? I'm tired of my life
Tired of the bullshit, tired of the nights
Tired of these girls keep ringing me at night
Telling them I'm at the ends, all the times I gotta lie
And I'm fed up of my boys mum dying
Nothing worse than to see your boys crying
I don't love or survive but I'm trying
And to say that I'm not scared would be lying

I see men that are bitches (I see)
I should leave them with stitches (I should)
I'm like "leave them, they're fishes" (fuck 'em)
But me da megalodon
I'm a great white shark, too big for the pond
Stones, sticks, come on
A lot of men move so wrong
I can't hack it, you little maggots, roll on (roll on)
Get back, stay away from me (stay back)
I gave some men their careers
And they wanna try shitting on me (me)
When I'm Tyson, I'm biting your ears (rah)
For as far as the eye can see
I see men that wanna flex like women
Chat shit behind backs and then shake hands (woah)
Cos they ain't got it in 'em (woah)

I would have rolled out to the end (you know)
And you wanna hate on me (who me)
I don't need no more new friends
Unless I come across Rachel Green (Rachel Green)
Eyes black like the Thames (yeah)
Fed up of the drama and beef
Why have grown men gotta get feelings
I blame shy FX's beat (one)
Its mad how loud that your actions speak
Poker, I'm sat whilst I'm reading faces
I don't like what I see
They got their eyes on me
Sheep wanna follow a grown men, me
Sleep in the hollows and hang from the trees
I don't like what they're talking, keep walking
Them man can't come around me

They say you're not a derogatory term for a female
I'm talking about men that should of been down
And turned out bitch
Peace out
We don't need no snake on the team now
Nor never, swordsmen sever
These fools that leisure
I've got one better
Entire pool in my whole cellar
Chainsaw, call me face or leather
And make your, decisions more wisely
Sweet feeling you're styley
You're all grown ass men
So stop bringing me down like wifey
All these indirects on the net don't send me a threat
Come find me
Cos you know where we are
In Drugnam and in blacked out cars

Welcome to my ghost ship
The one I resurrected like the Black Pearl
And had it stay afloat in
And from the day I boarded on this vessel
I feel as though I've done a lap of every single ocean
And the seven seas too, but I got the wind on my sails and a good crew
Of men who grew up in the same neighborhood I knew
And I will turn to sail to where the sky's forever blue
Along the way I learned of lives I never knew
And I can't shut my mouth, who am I to hide the truth
But really, who am I, just a navigator
Guided by the north star and now my time is due
I'll keep floating down the river till you see a pale figure roll up saying how'd you do
I'm like Columbus with the compass
So let me move

I started in a raft, I made into a craft
Then I was gone at the rasing of the mast
I've seen pain behind my craft
Cross paths and I see your ship alike like the Cutty Sark
In the woods where the pirates throw
In the water where the pirates dwell
I never justify the odds I defied myself
I said I'll never make this, horrible scenario, shape shift, yeah
And all my crews got a few stars like a Orion's Belt
We make the pilgrimage here upon a river full of tears that were taken from lost souls
Left to cry in hell, a cry for help
Is what this started as, but now my life's sick like the psychotic pitbull it's barking mad
How I came from nothing, now I control the water ways your barge is banned

My mum gave birth south of the Thames
Then I float down to this ghost town, now I call my ends
Where a county starts and the city ends
And I learned to be careful when you're picking friends
Between the few men we had to build a boat
Lie it low, just to keep the dream afloat
A lot of people thought that it was washed up
Hence the reason why they looked like they've seen a ghost
Call me Brook, call me Black Beard or Davy Jones
One captain that will send your whole navy home
And I will never rest with my skeleton
Therefore it's relevant you'll never call me lazy bones
So welcome to my ghost ship
That has promised me the one day it'll free my soul
So when the tide comes in upon the beat you know who knows
You know you might get to read my scrolls

I had to fight for my life, and nearly everything in it
This ain't just lyrics I’m bringing, I’m giving you insight into a world that I live in
Where if you don’t stand up, man up, you might as well be dead in the city that you sit in
I switched my life from an awkward position, I wanted more than working and still being poor
I don’t need criminologists proving that young men have acted like animals daily
Ain't that what you made this for, nothing inside but hatred and war
All I ever learn from policemen, was how to kick through a door
But I retain composure, now I can’t stop 'til the sun burns out
Life as you know it is over, I used to run around town
Thinking of scams and plans
Now you see my face on a poster, you must have thought that I was a no-hoper
Or a joker

Until the sun goes down, on every broken town that I'm rolling around
I'll have my heart on my palm and I show you my hand
Cause no matter what happened you won’t ever see me a broken man
My faculty throws them rations then we make dough when we share it around
I can feel a change in power, now life don’t seem so sour
I used to sign on then ride on when I told myself
That I weren't gonna work 'til I'm old for means to an end one more bloody hour
So, say hello to my ex boss he's still getting up at half five for a shower
Times are crazy in my wild this dream is a baby
I never did think that I would have been the best MC in the whole UK scene
'Til the sun goes down I'mma run this town like Rihanna and Jay-Z
There's no stopping me now, I’m a warrior now, I’m telling you, take heed

Until the sun no longer rises
The fall of mankind, the change of climates
You'll find me grinding, this life that I’m in
It’s full of surprises, but you'll still find them fighting
Until the sun no longer rises
The fall of mankind, the change of climates
You'll find me grinding, this life that I’m in
It’s full of surprises, but you'll still find them fighting

I'm on some off with your head shit
I keep firing, I'm not The Apprentice
Devs told me to go in, ah yeah
So I ran - blocked all the exits
Yes I'll be here forever
And tread so far I'll leave here in leather
So dark, so cold
With a couple girls sitting on my lap
I'm never gonna say I'm back
I'm a little too in love with plaques
I moved in to the hall of fame
So I wipe my feet on tracks
I'mma kill it, I'm a killer
See me with one glove, it's a Thriller
I already had a number one for my dinner
Me and Devs go in there, inner
And we're out of here, I doubt you're near
I've already been a thousand 'ere
But if you live for the money, then you die for the money
So I ain't even trying to count it, I swear
And if you don't think I'm fucked
Middle finger up
Fuck me, fuck you
I'll make you feel small when I big you up
Up, up and away, I can't see ya
On my own scale, I'm a Libra
Told 'em leave me alone, I wanna leave, uh
Had to give 'em some dough to get a pizza
Every day I have takeaway
Tomorrow won't be the same today
I don't score when I'm at home
I strike more when I play away

Shut down the asylum
Before I creep through the exit, find it
Jump any fence inside then drag a man
Out of the car that he just was driving
And then put the pedal to the floor
I'm back and I'm ready for the war like a Viking
I ain't gotta tell 'em any more, me and Wretch
Already killed this UK Grime thing
And there's not a lot left that could swing with Shipman
The doctor of death
Like Wretch 32 said it's off with his head
Got cold feet then it's frost on your creps
Never mind where you're walking, watch where you step
Mind what you're talking, I might dissect
Any guy trying a bullshit vibe on a sec
Can't fuck with me like my wife on the reds
Too unorthodox to let it go
So I let 'em know that I'm pro, but my name ain't Stephen
Soul seems to be involved
I'm burying men six deep in a hole, no reason
You're getting buried alive, I'm tryna better my life
While some men are cutting up suits
With scissors and severing ties
I let 'em know that it's Devlin's time
No disputing I shift to the move
This game from the days of The Movement
Using the only utensil I knew to
Now I need loot this, alike to my figures on YouTube
Retreat or advance then, you choose
At the present I'm king like Presley
Test me, then I'm running out full of anger
And envy and stamping you out in my blue shoes

Ride a beat like a Traktor, ey
But I ain't getting on a train, 'ey
Everybody wants to act up, yeah
'Til you put 'em in the frame
And I ain't got time for shit, patience's thinner than my toilet roll
I'm a fixed up brother from a broken home
I remember I used to watch Home Alone
Now I'm home alone in my own home
This millennium, got a loada dome
Rome then roam
Came home smelling like hot Cologne
Had a success overdose, oh
You see my roll-on flow
And I'm so sure that I can't be old
Yet all my heels I carry on toe to toe
When we take this game now, so cologne

You couldn't play my post
I'm an old soul like an ancient ghost
That created his name in the game and he
Took shit to another level on the whole
I can't really explain my brain
But if you peeked inside of my skull
You'd see shit so deep in my rear right lobe
That you'd know why I feel this cold
And I feel like the caped crusader
Here on the brink of a dangerous caper
I'm always collected and calm in battle
Can't be rattled, go sample a shaker
OT, I'm an out taker
I'm taking out any men that are minor
And think that they're major, there's a devil and a
Wretch that just broke out of the chamber

Yes, now I'm going for the hat-trick
One singer, one model, one actress
But I might disappear if you're acting
Or singing me a new tune on a mad pitch
Back to my rap shit
I'mma go hard this year
Can't be looking at the past this year
That won't help me get past this year
In an extra zone next to tracks
Multiple hits but with extra swag
I've divided my time
Royalties won't forget to add
And I ain't adding nobody on my BB
IPhone when I want you to see me
I played, YouTube
See me on Wretch 32 TV

I'm getting flashbacks from the past
Head full of hate and a mouth full of bars
Me and Wretch just stretched this game to a next span
Taking the extra yard
We're going extra hard, no I can not be barred
Say what you want, but you couldn't keep Devs out
Anyways, I've already broke through the fence now
And I'm quite relentless when I vex out
Everybody wants to the the next out
But they get stripped like a bitch when her dress down
Think you're a face round 'ere?
Get left lying face down in a next town
Pull strings like Robbie Lamond
On the beat and I'm dropping the bomb
I'll make you all feel sick like Sue Bo dropping her thong
This ain't Sumo but I'm too big and too strong

See me I'm walking, why cause i don't run fam
Make a film about me find a proper fucking stuntman
I'm captain wiz and I'm actually shoving dirt in a dustpan
And blowing it back in faces of wastemen who try and brush man
I get a wheel in the club on the microphone
They didn't know I handle bars, it's a minor though
They offered me some gear but I'm over tired
All this talkin make a bredda wanna cycle home, yo
I flabbergast that bredda my stamina can be coming in handy
Flipping the script, I'm doing a what? I'm telling a story, doing a plan B
How the fuck on earth did we become so angry?
Couple years ago, man was just reading the dandy
So how'd I go from reading the beano to beating up emos
Swimming in speedos to swinging in chinos
Mimicking heroes to zeros
From Zoro to Tarantinos, we're living like wierdos
I guess the level of violence increases as the fear grows, but
Just can't spit on beats, I'mma spit acapella
Don't think I won't rap a fella
Smack that nigga make an aki swell up, leave him black and yellow
I ain't talking Wiz Khalifa, this wiz kidda the beater, you a rancid dweller
Got the dank piff in my cellar, I'm the dank piff seller
Thing is smelling way too much so wrap that in some cella
Celebrate ca man wan tell a mate about this massive fella
On the beat, and on the tune there ain't no aki better fassies fed up
Yo, in my raps, there's unlimited lyrics and syllables
Hitting my pinnacle isn't a miracle it's kinda literal
Feeling a feeling that's minimal
Physical feeling it's more of a spiritual
Hearing a visual audible justification of lyrically winning
That's why I be spitting again, and again and again
Gripping the tip of the pen, hitting a spliff of the lem
They lyrically stepping to me and I be lyrically stepping to them Yeah they levelling up but I'm levelling better than them
Tell it to lesser men wizzy be stressing 'em
Never addressing 'em, never ever again, never ever again

Watch me, clock me, knock me but don't stop me
I got flocks that watched and got knocked knee properly
I got props from lots of chops it's often got me
Gassed as a motherfucker lost and cocky, what G?
You can't tell me that i don't win
Ca on the beat I'm like a granddad I go in
Unique bredda yeah I got my own thing
You neek, you're not unique with gold rings
I'm a young brother with a lot of heart
Been at it from the start, I can tell you're gonna chart
But how you gonna hold a man when older man ain't half as smart Trying to control a man like Zola can in Upton Park
I'm holding more knowledge than a folder can
I'm focused and you know I love my art
Ain't no more holding grams For Ocean man
Notice that I know my plan
Teedot told me Ropa Dope's a joke you need to go for man
So Ocean goes for man, I owe you fam
Owe you dat, came in the game with a whole new act
Invading the brain with a whole new rap
Blatantly stating that your whole crew's wack
I had to do that, had to man up
If you ain't got the balls to copy then bad luck
You ain't got the balls to copy you fat fuck
You ain't got the balls to copy I'm that much, I got
Exquisite ability mimicking vividest imagery lyrically stinging a killer bee
Killing the similes willyly nillily, wanna be chillin with Fiddy and Diddy
And Cudi the Kidy listening to Biggie
Buming a ciggy with Dizzy and Weezy
Sucking a titty like giggiddy giggiddy, my ability can't mimic me
Flow, buggsy, bigadibobadi
Gota be properly on it to stop a G
Copping the hottest of property, not a monopoly
Actual life, ain't no topping me, stopping and floppin is comedy
Honestly quality optical oddities, not in an oddessy
Tell a man straight you've been warned, no wallaby
Ca man ain't feelin the court, don’t follow G's
People we need to abort this policy horriblly
Course discographies making me feel like I'mm waring constantly
Applaud and follow me

But I ain't even trying to be that type of guy
Ain't trying to be that type of breh
Ain't tryng toa lead that type of life you know
I ain't even trying to meet myself a wife
Ain't trying to meet myself a dame
I'm trying to keep myself alright, you know
I feel the sudden rush of heat when I'm on stage
I don't compete with none you pagans
Cause it's peak to fuck with wastemen
My flow is sweet I know the streets they love to taste it
But im feelin undertakerish, putting niggas in graves and shit
Ask True Fizz, us man are runnin shit
But the truth is, these other man are runnin quick
But if the shoe fits, wear it, and it fits me
I'm runnin oh so quickly, so stick me
On the top of the roster where Big be
Big beats got me feeling like twigs in a sandwich I stick to the wrap
No giving it back
I'm flipping a packet of cigs, ripping the cig down the mids
Sprinkling cig on my riz, sprinkling piff on the cig on the riz
Sprinkling cig on the piff on the cig on the riz
Twist it an get it lit, nigga what

Manifested this one
Man come through in all black and just nick something
Limelight robber, the limelight teefer
Dem man are busy bunnin’ on their reefer
They never got the memo
That a fellow from the south spitting ether
So either they deaf or they dumb, if neither
They’re mocking it, they’re rocking something silly for the feature
They’re gimmicky they’re relevant for now with no longevity
The remedy for that is how you body with them readily so woah
I ain’t got to study how another brother flow
Listen to a legend make a better rapper grow
Better for competitors that are living with a pro
Swinging with a donny you’re swinging with Ali G
Man’s really in a hurry to build up another lead
Brilliant and lovely looking at the esteemed
Considering every challenge resulted in their defeat
They beat the beat, I eat the beat
Then beat the beat, I treat the beat right
I beat the beat boss, betray me and die
You be the bowcat, your head between thigh
Runnin’ on my (cuppa?) they be shutting down
She sucking on something and then she duckin’ out
I done a show with the baddest man about
I'll turn a gunner into a daffodil
Dem man dere holding Ls
Dem man ain’t holding Zs
And that’s fact
Dem man are already tell I’m on too much for them try rev
Like “Why you tryna rev?”
About revvin’ my face
On a Sunday
Till I hit man with a awkward leg
Awkward elbow, top of the head
Like boom baow, put him to bed
Like Joe Rogan said a man like me ain’t seen that in a thousand fights
Man got clocked with a vibrant right
And a hesitant left, is a man still alive?
Watch how I jump on the tune with Dyl
I'm the real deal, dem man all hype
Got a man feeling all Dillian Whyte
No dilly, no dally, I flick out the light

How you gonna come and try rev
How you gonna act like I’m not ahead
And you’re stuck on the red
You’re easily read
Like you’re playing dead
I’m a rebel
I’m ready whenever my level is heavy
You’re light as a feather I beg
Beg you know I’m a celeb
But I’m dreading I’ll put you to bed
For some shit that you should have just thought but you said
‘Cause you’re a pleb
Only concern should be getting this bread
Are you pulling my leg
Gone in the head
Copper and lead
He drops and he bled
Go get a doctor and send for the med
You should have fled
Dearly departed
Look what you gone and you started
You bumbaclart
Should have been smart
But you were retarded instead
Use your brain
Don’t lose your lane
Maintain
Refrain from saying my name
And I’ll do the same
And everything’ll be right as rain
Don’t go against the grain
‘Cause I can get a little off the chain
Gassed up on my own no shame
Like I’m off the mains
They’re looking at me like I’m at the wrong stop
And I got no ticket
I just hop the train
What have I got to gain
I already gained the fame
I already got/copped the Range
I come through like Dr Strange
Tell the lane miss me with the games
I don’t entertain
Cocaine flow in your vein
But I bring the pain
Give me the long story short don’t make me strain
So I can see you all clear and plain
I’m not a plain Jane
I got Jane insane
Hopping on the cane
She give me top then I rock it again
She give me Brighton dome
I’m up bright and early
With a brighter bone
Even when I’m in Rome
I feel right at home
The beat got me in a tighter zone
I could have jumped at your hype
But I like my own
And I’m kind of grown
I heard Ocean Wisdom said somebody better get that boy on the phone
Let him do what he does
Don’t change one tone
Just leave him alone

Eighteen I was eight deep
With a great beat
Lately manna make P
From a G
Hopefully manna wrote down a couple notes on me
Oh did he not
He don’t know about me
Okay no kidding man a note of me
And then globally fandom are (roll?) for me
Hours on a beat
Okay mandem on a show for me
They’re a nobody
With the way they facilitate what I do bait
And a anecdote for me
Would be high road for me
And I didn’t ride out on a wasteman wave
That’s a woah woah buddy
You should body down for me
I’ll be showing you the ropes
When you trying to just rave
Why help bodies that are not that gully
When you could be summoning the best of the greats
No sales dummy
That is not that funny
When you got to rely on the O for the cake
Still fuck it then I fornicate the day away where I get up and I made a (pip?) and then I get to press it on her puss
Luckily the way they gravitate to what I’m doing got them reaching in their pockets, dedicated to the cause
‘Cause they feel a man and follow man and run around the city
Like an animal I put them on their paws
‘Cause the mandem want to draw
As they thought they was I’m on a Wu-Tang vibe on tour
Bill a spliff and let me talk
I ain’t fiddlin with pork
Licking on her loin
Ripping something raw that’s savagery
Man’s been on it since Mark and Valerie
This bar cost man calories
Smash and attack
Eubank swag get a bang in the mouth
Junior swag hold 25 more
Wiz be a fan of just having it out
I run up a tab I told them the score

Brighton town where you find me, I'm on the high street
I got the best flow, Coming all rhymey, I got the high grade
And i spit grimey, see me on itunes, and they just buy me
True I move right here, Can't get by me,I got whole album
And it's all by me, I roll with the biro, ryan had a baby
Now it's all hard work, now it's all lively

Back in the day when I gave mum backchat
She would try tell a man 'AH AH'
Now I do that if a mana try act bad
Gus got done but, Now he's a bad man
Din't go vegas, or play blackjack
Beat up dealers, robbed man's afghan
Now mans got blue cheese and dank fam
Write bars like Anne Frank
I get live on a hype occasion
One fan from show tried a Spitely statement
Tried to put Wiz down, tryna diss Jamaican
So I shagged mans mum for the violation

Like OH

Why you tryna fight with stathen
Tryna war with four of ya
Getting drawn in payments
Tell a man I wanna chat let their thought amaze em
When they can't pool thoughts when they draw a statement

On tracks, Me I don't rhyme when I rap
Me i just grime when I rhyme puff dank in a flat

Toast

Anchor on that, if i gotta hanker and jam I know dat mans
Overly on it, I got the dough in my wallet
And when I pull on my pocket I'm seeing permanent profit
It's like the man they wanna chat like they Capone or Gotti
And they be running with the shotty for a kick or a hobby

I know a couple man they riding really didn't seem properly
Better if everybody do it tell me where did the body be
Tryna get some money tryna get into property
Everybody wanna stomach coz I'm doing it cockily

I mother fucking hate slacker

I don't role with no out the backers, no I don't role with no lazy man coz
That makes man flip like acrobatics

Like oh my, golly these guys want test like i won't try act dramatic
I'll Learn the role then I'll smash the practise, then turn up late
Shag the actress, see verb with the limp bars die for acting
And a also look like a bag has packed him, and the also rare, fans are clapping
But the girls embarrased to try an clap the act

I'm like, nowadays every body wanna talk like they got something to spray
But nothing comes out when they loading clips, they just talking shit
But still man wanna chat like they guns are blazing, got great form
I'm in great form, and I'm greatful for that withdraw, I've been on tour
I ain't been on telly, then i fuck off home like I piss off kelly

But man went from cotching to pingu, to blotting, to hindus
Then back to the igloos, I'm cold, our tier man are just big news
That's when the gallywan lick on semis i come back to the floor like i'm pissed already
I'm getting back from the show, pissed all ready and i'm bad with the bone in my bitches belly

I got a bag from michone from the ghetto lady you know

You one of them wouldn't and couldn't man
That couldn't afford a bag of the buddha man, me?
I'ma jetlag and then travel and then go into camp for a can on a boulevard, you?
You went clown now you're talking all loud and you tell a man lowe of the western wild out
Even though higher man think that's a lie that gotta you man what that's about

On the real though
I dont know nothing bout whats-his-face, but whats-his-face know something bout wizzy
I grew up on Marley and Macy and lizzy and wu tang, rumcon, fiddy and dizzee
Chilling with fizzy and bizzy and gizzy, growed with streez and meags and billy
Shot food with seller man halves now kilian, catches man on the can that's brilliant

Progress, got my own test, I don't need your one, two's get drawn on
You man are falling asleep with the porn on
Me I'm on stage tryna keep my own drawers on, simple as that
I give em a sprinkle of swag, now they wanna sink in a lap, I ain't simple as that
And I ain't got a tip for a slag, I ain't tryna dip in the hag, lets go now

Brighton town where you find me, I'm on the high street
I got the best flow, Coming all rhymey, I got the high grade
And i spit grimey, see me on itunes, and they just buy me
True I move right here, Can't get by me,I got whole album
And it's all by me, I roll with the biro, ryan had a baby
Now it's all hard work, now it's all lively

Brighton town where you find me, I'm on the high street
I got the best flow, Coming all rhymey, I got the high grade
And i spit grimey, see me on itunes, and they just buy me
I move wisely, Can't get by me,I got whole album
And it's all by me, I roll with the biro, ryan had a baby
Now it's all hard work, now it's all lively

I hear 'em talking, hear 'em talking
Love the way they want to wheel up Walkin'
Love the way they see the way I kill it
See the way I bring the chalk in
See the outline of the body when I draw it
Everyone adore it, awe its
Fuck off with your one liners
Everybody co-sign us, I don't do no consigning
I got rent to pay, so I don't need no odd fivers
I'm the boss brudda, you are not Simon
You're not vibrant, you're not funny
Got no money, ripped trackies
You're so bummy, I'm so aggy
She's so touchy, she's so grabby
I'm so lucky, she's so sucky
That yatty, she's so ucky
With no manners, she's so raggers
I've got Bills, like Bo Baggins, she's just catting
Like "fuck where's the old fashion"
Tight madams, they ain't shagging
First date cause they like rapping

Burning California wax, still ignore him when he raps
My lyrics like the echo through time, forever calling back
Fed up with the crap, we can do this in time
Suckers saying I'm dumb, must be them chalking my outline
Stroke my only oyster, you're still trying to find the moisture
My last album sounds like your whole career spoiler
Mad pointers like a piston caught with no lawyers
In the stitch up, the details in the lines like embroiders
It's diabolic, trying to be higher like hydraulics
Even with a ghost writing team you ain't where I'm on it
Sign off it, ignite topics to fire logic
Drop a needle from so high you would think a giant's got it
Performing for your line with piff from a caravan
Every word I say spells 'FUCK YOU' as an anagram
Never planned, too stoned to speak or shake hands
In 2020 the new president of Amsterdam

I swoop in and high five you for the ice breaker
It's Big Owl, mad high like a skyscraper
My motto's 'Live now and die later'
Grinding 9 to 9 son, fuck a hiatus
But I hit the bong today, never on a long delay
Shouting at these motherfuckers "Andale! Andale!"
Why you gotta make away still, with the hand of Satan
He try shake mine, son I'm going to amputate his
Dropping bangers that are amping up the fanbases
Having ganders cause they're scandalous and outrageous
Paparazzi got us snapping when we smash stages
Do this for the love and always get cash payments
You're sat stagnating, no balls, castrating
Pre-meditated greatness, no rash statements
Phone getting tapped daily like ash when blazing
So high right now, it's like I'm astral planing

It's Verb T, I'm in the club
I don't like it much
But I tear the crowd down once you line 'em up
Winding up your mind like a toy, soldier
Pouncing on the beat like a poised, cobra
Uh, we get to grips like it's judo
But show respect where it's due though
Since I was a kid trying to build without the Duplos
Still I carve jewels though
Drop 'em on your head like a tombstone
Two O's, one for Owls, one for Ocean
New flows, some profound some ferocious
Overdid it with the lotion, I'm too smooth
New trends, probably got them fools wearing Tu-tu's
You should do you, and not what they say
I laugh while you try and talk shit with a straight face
Mug, maintain, fucking with a gateway drug
In another world feeling that space age buzz

Mad laid-back, style's 'play that'
The great sack reacting with the goon, now I spray raps
Hungry dog, or a stray cat, strange chat
See me doing art on the side, just like a train track
So shouts to Wizzy, the beaver getting digy on the ready
Smoking lettuce with Luigi from the city
Puff puff, but never Diddy
I might pass out, but never passed it like silly
Yo
No doping scandal, what drugs we're dope enough to handle
So much moisture, spit flames where the river ran through
Four Owls and the Wisdom, you know it ran through
Take control of your life, don't need no beads and bangles
That's why we're strictly rhyming on this shit
Fuck statistics, can't follow with no witch shit
No bitches, what is this?
Course evidence existed, but never do you wrong, so no snitches

Advice, bruddah want advice
That's pressure on my iris man, that's pressure on my eyes
That's pressure on my sinus, now there's pressure on my mind
See I put pressure on my peers, that they put pressure on them diamonds
Wait, lies, tellin' all these lies
Man got all these guns and knives and man got all these wives
Man got all this clientele to buy and sell these nines
Kilos, these bars, q's, 3-5's
Most guys spend ages just wasting their time
These times I'm time saving, chasing what's mine
Can't be celebrating 'til the wages getting wide
They getting wide off their wages, celebrating for the night
You're choosing to be hype, while I cruise into that drive
Man got two cents I don't care about, it's all nuisance when he rhyme
But these youtdem a don't write, I gotta say free mandem inside
Gotta say these relevant rhymes that I spit, teach eloquence fine (so fine)

Really I'm a master of the wave, just a master of my craft
Not a jack of every trade
Little carcass in their car, suttin earlier I've made
See I drop a little bar and leave them burning from the spray
Really win the race, yours are right I'm on the road
So they pree the way I'm walking and they copy with a stroll
Little did they know that I just manifest the goal
And if they get up in my way I may just manifest the pole
Swing it in your face, swing it in your jaw
Look at all the teeth, spinning on the floor
Had a second thought, before he hit the floor
But it's to late for all them things, ca' you brought drama to the door

It's intrinsic, Wiz win
This dim nitwits drip diction, this year I might end this kids
Get them two cheap big bits, put them in the pocket
And then send them to your guy, fall for the profits your dissing
Ey listen fickle fam, pick another cell, pick another gang
Pick another girl, pick another world
You are not aloud here little man
Mandem on the road fully know Wizzy, I walked in hella dough with me
I rolled out and I stretched out and I growed that ca' the whole scene wanna fuck with me
I know dat and I love dat and I'll hold that fully close to me
There's ten a penny that are scoping me, there little bars are a joke to me
I feel a fine kind of form coming on, I wouldn't wanna be approaching me
I wouldn't wanna be a wasteman, Wizzy wouldn't wanna be a nobody
I'm a winner, wouldn't wanna be a window washer
While they wanna wheel, I wouldn't wonder why I'm waking up or why the demographic do a sicker version
I'm a problem on them mandem, mandem manna know me
Well I'm in it for the millie, believe in my self and I'm killing it really
My fan dem are feeling me, big in the city
Man never come really, the way that I came with the villain
I showed everybody that I'm lyrically silly, I bet 'em a billy but top of the bill
And I bet him a bill he weren't better than Wizzy
Them man ain't even relevant evidently, we're ahead of the resident
Partly because of the physical regiment, mainly because of the whit and intelligence
Tellin' them turn up, I'll turn up, I'll turn it in
Turn up for dinner whilst I'm eating venison looking all elegant
I'm in my element, if you are levelling where is the evidence nobody deading
Your militant meaning I'm overly permanent, venomous
Meaning promoters are overly generous
Meaning I'm getting my bill without benefit
Hell of a life I've been living, I'm loving the life I've been living
I live for the hell of it, moving all menacing
I be the nemesis, overly devilish
Why you embellishing? Look at the heavy ting
Move like a wedding ring, hereditary
Wizzy benevolent, look at my property nearly got ten of 'em
I know they are listening, Wizzy be shelling 'em
Them man are uppity nobody belling 'em
They're talking like they really want it when I see them mandem in the flesh
Everybody wanna comment on how the lyric Wizzy dropping be the best
Eenie meanie minie wouldn't even matter spinning Wizzy on the deck
Everybody wanna see the Wizzy, when the Wizzy walking on the step

I'm comin' straight outta Brighton
A crazy motherfucker named Wizzy
Sirens in the city like I'm rollin 'round with Dizzy
You was in the basement with a plectrum gettin' picky
I was in the basement with a couple eigths I'm gettin' sticky
(It's like a) It's like a OOH!
Makin' a brudder go high pitched
All of these mandem are tellin' me that when I get on the mic it's a hype ting
Vibezin', don't wanna hear no violin
Big beat from the Dike like sick sick sick! that time again (it's that time again!)

Look, I ain't hittin' it back I'm splittin' the racket
You got that literal whackness spread upon your lyrical sandwich
All of my brothers be lovin' the way I be spittin' erratic
Rappin' as sick as the fashion, never my mind on 'em, I'll spit in the face of an enemy
Wizzy be movin' like hazardous

For music I'm jet settin' like Led Zeppelin
I hate talking love rappin' I intend reppin'
Fuck bench pressin' I cover my food in French Dressin'
Playin' football munchin' on a pasty call me Gregg Beckham
Oh no brudda ya listenin' to a megolomanic
Master of modesty that contrast is enigmatic
And I could pin it backwards
Plus I got my pick of the perfect places to pen a passage
Watch me pitter patter to different parts of a written pattern
Plus alliteration a wicked blag for a sicker stanza
Watch me dip in lava, my fickle thoughts in this sea of magma
Plus I got the slang to decipher gibber blacker than Sagna
Mad with the grammar I tell 'em

I ain't hittin' it back I'm splittin' the racket
You man are visibly vapid me I got that visceral package
All of my mandem are lovin' the way I be givin' them classics
They're in-equivalent rappers I'm an extravagant brudda
I'm doin' it rancid they call me the king and the captain (yeah)
They call me the king and the captain
Plus they accompany that with a couple of compliments
Catered to keep me from killing them
I never tolerate nonsense
I rush the world around to keep myself from slowin' down
But slow it down on tracks so you can judge whether my word's profound

How many ways can I say what I wanna say
Say what I wanna say how many ways can I
Just came in a scrum that's proper gay
Spray like a copper's AK
In the states of mind
Used to be on it mate
Didn't cooperate, gobbling wallets and swatting braids
These days couldn't be bothered mate
Me, I want proper wages to take mumsy on holiday
Yo
Theres lots we can offer brave
Other than a mean stare and a dodgy eighth
So what you're a nice brer with a dodgy mate
I seen a nice guy knock out a proper snake
I don't want a sentence, me I wanna break
So I wrote a sentence with a proper break
For a breather like Skepta did
Nah I'm not a dreamer cus it's on a plate
Achoo!
Yo, I know guys that are funny and horrid
They only get p if the money is borrowed
And they get so licked that they can't walk
And they fall face first and duppy their foreheads
And you got mad girls round here
Don't get me started I won't finish cus they show promise
First they wanna diss me then they wanna kiss me
And then they wanna hit me then draw for the bollocks
How you gonna fuck with my head like that
Like I won't switch kick, took a bitch to the forest
Take her to a wood shack
Fairytale vibe
Likkle blond ting
Force feeding Goldilocks' porridge
I ain't even on that vibe
But I like that vibe, if you like that vibe you're a nobend
Yeah I just clocked what I said if you clock you're a twat then you got it
If not you're a novice

Check
If man holla me for the 3 I'll be more than obliged
Writing a rhyme when I'm bored in the night time
Fighting a Mike Tys, that guy in my mind
Write with a right fight with a mic 'til i write something nice
That they might like, like mike I be young jumping for high times
I'm a white guy and a black guy in a brown guy
How high was a good film because it outlined heist niggas
Trying to to fit in with them white niggas
I be spitting son quite vicious
Im a bredda with a nice image
I come pricker with a quite different, quite different
Ice ridden cold flow nice wid it
I said "mum give me my spinach"
She said "eat little boy stop hyping it"
Now I'm altogether like a nice village
But I'm in a cold place like a icepick is
Neat sweet ting by rag and bone
Gave her the neat sweet ting when I rag and boned her
My tings long
I been on the map on alton prince kong
We be in the cab with crow and tings on
Busy with rum kush with the stay piff
Dont gizzie with the free c's with the new song
Got pars looking wavey for 1-6
'Till I clocked Mitch say no wizzie ain't drunk
Bigs and prospects are bredrens
Me I got big prospects with bredren's don
Got objections to resting, but we find its odd
To pretend to be strong
Im in the box with a klaxon
Watch when I pop out and smash them
It's overly long
So you know when I'll be making the pie
When the rest of the man, dem are singing our song

Why you wanna give it like I won't bite
Like I won't retaliate with a throat strike
Might wanna consider pushing the boat out
Shit wouldn't wanna get banned like a hosepipe
In the middle of summer flooding the whole block
New money be killing all of the old off
You should be happy, you're lucky I never sold out
I just came in and killed it and nearly bowled off
Pull a number on anybody that wanna know
Swinging from the top of the building, singing Geronimo
Gotta keep it moving and get it wherever I wanna go
Spit it on the track and I whip round, I'm Monoco
Blow, whole budget on a class B
Dealing with everything that you nar see
Pull a middle finger for anybody that pass me
Man is fully fledged with the pleasure to keep it nasty
Plus I'm bridging a big gap now
Wrap round
Fuck a long living
Cover the background
Did it like I was little Italy when I sat down
All these little bitches are feeling me like a pat down
Wow
How my life done change in a big way
And I managed to remain unscathed is beyond me
Funny how I stay John Blazed and unfazed while everybody gaze like a zombie
You lot are stuck in a time warp
Could never see you treading on the levels that I walk
Could never see you moving in the circles of my sort
Runnin' my time short
The big fucking brother that try talk
I've heard it, dunno how to word it
"How do you say"
Shit been murdered
Dicks inserted
Blips on the screen don't even exist unless you observe them
Get me
Stick 'em in a dish no bigger than a Petri
Fuck a white coat, can't test me
Fuck a blue collar with a Pepsi
Why you so techy?
Me and a bottle of that prescy
See you tomorrow when that gets me
Opa!
Man I'm on the move like the prince of Zamunda
Telling me the royal penis is clean while I'm humming that theme by Timon and Pumba
Everything's smooth and nimble
Might get moved for your two shoes, both your socks, your laptop, tablet and Kindle and catch a middle finger symbol
Or we could just keep it simple, sit down and eat some Pringles
Talk bullshit and spit some waffle all over this instrumental
That's why we gettin' all weird and experimental like
"Yeah!"

Repeat, repeat cause I do real talk
That's G speak
On the road, road runner like beep beep
Got a dank little pack not a Chief Keef
This little nigga wanna, rap a song about
Shit he's sounding like a Chief Keef
So I like to kill a riddim, rah fuck it
It's about time I should teach these
Like rahtid, man took a Z to the brain
Still putting arm and a leg when I step on the stage
Man took a juck in the face for a boy
Man took a hook and replaced it with flame
Swear now all now man are not raw
Swear down all now man are not rage
Swear I might fly New York on a hype
U.S better put some respek on my name
Might dash two bills when I eat out
Now I don't know nothing 'bout beansprout
Like man can't tell me about green now
Obscene now, i'm top of the scene now
Have you seen how i'm top of the scene, no?
Like I was just reading a Beano
Like I was just beating the beat now
Skippy uppercut then cut the beat out
Might buoy off a prick if he's cocky
That's suit for a short and stocky
But try clash Wis on the track
That's like a black man playing ice hockey
No I dont really like one line flows
But I drop one and it's all moshy
I'm in the Ritz eating a big breakfast
Brother you're in the cafe like hot coffee
Sicker than ever
Pick an endeavour, everyone of them i'm killing i'll be bigger and better
I swear you man are full of shit you should be given an enema
And i'll never in my life will I give in to competitors
And I eminem a nigga with an eminem-y sentence
Couldn't ever try and emulate our presence, never!
Ever try and follow in my stairs, never!
Should have been embarrassed to test us, ever!
Why? Me and Dabbla's calibre is infallible
Mandibles fully dangling naturally cause of us man
Mans sick with the ramblings in your capital
Naturally, them are gassed when them mandem come buck man
I'm skip with the ham with it
I'm sicker than man with it
I'm wicked and bad with it, trust man
You're lickle and sad with it
Fickle and blam with it
Brittle and flat like a dust man
Repeat, repeat cause I do real talk
That's G speak
On the road, road runner like beep beep
Got a dank little pack not a Chief Keef
This little nigga wanna, rap a song about
Shit he's sounding like a Chief Keef
So I like to kill a riddim, rah fuck it
It's about time we should teach these
Dabbla..

Look, I don't pick coins off the roadside
I'm worldwide
I don't know nothing about no likes
In fact I don't know nothing about ghostwrites
But I know a little something 'bout wrote mine
Oh my, they're so Myan
They're predicting shit but they're so lying
Looking at man like I'm no Simon
Like they're bossing me I get so Simon
Get so violent, start clotheslining
O in here like blowdrying
Got hoes on the pole, I ain't no fireman
Got bear on the pole like cold climates
Oh my, they're so admiring
How the O rolls through like a known giant
Looking at man like I'm no Simon
Like they're bossing me I get so Simon
It gets tragic, I swear man is embarrassed
Just like how the fuck did they manage?
Just like how the fuck did they cope?
If that was me I swear I wouldn't have it
Man's got all the flows that you got
But you can't hack the flows that mans chatting
Hancock called and said "d'you know what
That's too much might to match when O's rapping"
So what do you reckon? Do you be willing
Beca' you'll probably be following second
Everybody in my city got a hobby for heckling
Til I roll up and they realise the prodigy step in
And then they shush
Quiet, big man might throw you in a bush
Quiet, big man you can't tell me about push
Might push, push, push 'til I can't push
Can't tell me 'bout woos
Old school like actual soccer
I catch a couple mandem claiming that they're casually blotting
I afa roll up on em tell em all to pack up and stop it
And a couple mandem on the wing, and regretting their shottin
And everybody love it when I tell em bigady-bobady
Yeah they love it when Wizzy tell em bigady-bobady
Got a couple mandem chatting to me shit at philosophy
I ain't really tryna hear it, I ain't listening properly
But blud, you would get pounded and ate
On the high street or your mum's or your mate's
Man's got a sick flow
Your flow sounds like my flow did in 2008
Scrap that, got thousands of drawers
And I press best
Leave galdem a sore
Cause man's got a big [woo]
Your [woo] looks like my [woo] looked in 2004
How's that for a pause?
Niggas don't rap anymore
No panache anymore
Its all acme and wore
Them man saying same stuff that a man said before
She want at me and talk
Like her photos hiding her acne and warts
Like I won't notice that's she's naturally raw
Blud you pressed that and it's actually awks
So while you're pressing these
Heterosexual, bisexuals and lesbian tings
I be fuckin intense at festivals
But I ain't fuckin' in tents, that's grim!
She be clucking for sumtin
She be sucking on sumtin
She loving the way that we link
I swear these man they want test my gang and a brudda don't know what to think!

That's a feat, not a rollerblade
I want four mils in a day
Like I'm overweight
I am for real
Not a fake
There ain't no debate
I see some guys iPods
And it's loads of Drake
I play my song
Why not listen to O today?
You want the big bars
Me, I want the Oz of haze
Lets make an exchange
Like best mates with SNES games
I don't play no shit my homie
Fuck about a rappin' phony
Only real ones get the dokey
O's inside like macaroni
Swear I got the batest flows
Plus I got some sicker ones
Catch me watching snuff films
I don't watch no Chicken Run
I don't pick no daffodils
Catch me picking sticky punk
Dynamo's a pal still

Until I'm gone!
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me

Look I turned up in a top hat
Like I ain't heard about WhatsApp
Like don't tell me I'm old fashioned
Like don't tell me I ain't got swag
Like mans about it
I'm certified
And I'm rolling round with this Dirty Dike
Swear down the way
That man draws the crowd
Its like they should give me the Turner Prize
So don't stop me baby
Like spermicide
Watching like you ain't heard a rhyme
Me and my mandem got chips
You man sucking on curly fries!
Allow this rap pattern
Back track and slow it down
I'm back slanging raps
So I can churn it out
That's word to wise

I'm known for tryna sing a couple bar
Get my rag and bone on like Lah-de-dah-de-dah
But everytime I sing they really wish that I would go
And so I start to cry "They only love me for my flow!"

So I'ma be giving them more of that more of that
Tell me my singing is poor and that poor and that
So I be giving them flow and they loving the way that I'm fully performing that, oh
Syllables falling
I’m fully enthralling 'em
I make em reciprocate
Give em a call and
They give a response
Wizzy the don
I'm on the road
I'm going I'm gone!

So watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
Until I'm gone!
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me

So watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
Until I'm gone!
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me

They told me stop getting high
Focus on your songs
I said why, Dirty Dike's the man
And Ocean is a Don
Watch me go until I'm gone
I know you'll miss me
They said I'm not the second coming but they won't convince me!
I'm squeezing titties like I'm holding stress balls
She's pussy-popping like a blow up sex-doll!
While you stitch up yourself
The police don't need to interrogate
Cause your album sounds more like a fucking confession tape!
I woke up to two bitches sharing my cock
Got straight back on canon
Hair of the dog
Never hungover
Get a steamer in my cupholder
Bout to give these fat lasses a once over
I go out and get drunk til its daytime
At the bar chatting up girls looking disabled
If I'm lucky my brain might think of something to say
Like "Pull my fly down and drink me under the table!"

So watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
Until I'm gone!
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me

So watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
And watch me go
Until I'm gone!
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me

12 in the mornin', pop shells for a livin'
And berry gon' smell blood trail every minute
Rogue wave on you niggas, no fail when I hit 'em
Every time I see a pig, I don't hesitate to kill 'em
Ain't nobody give a fuck about a rule
Either get diplomas or a tool, I'ma cool with my youngins
No bool when I'm sprayin' this K at you fuckas
Fuck a gang affiliated with nothin' but my name

People be starvin'
And people be killin' for food with that crack and that spoon
But these rich mothafuckas, they stay eatin' good
Droppin' wage livin' good
Holdin' steel Glocks, but you been a bitch, suck a thick cock
Fuck a Crip walk, hit the strip like in Bangkok
Never ever see me ever trip 'bout a lil' broad
See me on the TV screamin', "Bitch, you a damn fraud"
And you don't wanna fuck with a chigga like me
When I pull up in that Maserati
Better duck 'fore ya brain splatter on the concrete
I'ma hit you with that .45, bullet hit yo neck round the bow tie
Lookin' like a thriller, film a bitch
I'ma go right back with the clip and I know you be shakin'
Don't test me or I might just click at yo noggin

Way more with you
Had too much of these hoes
Never told you 'bout the summer that I spent with my bros
Doin' things like your legs
Just gon' stay open now they closed
Thought I'd fix the road
But now you out here flyin' on your own
Nah…

All these parties I attend
But never know the celebration
I let you do what you want
No need for explanation
You go through my mind all day
All night, it feels like immigration
One of these days I'll fuck around
And book a flight up to Manhattan
Don't wanna see you go but I'd do the same as you
Don't see why you would go back to seein' me when you
Didn't wanna hurt my feelings but I couldn't get a clue
Didn't wanna seem perceivin bout the things that you pursue

Yo' bitch on me but you can never do nothing
'Cause yo' momma raised a pussy
Everytime I walk to the drop top, can't help but
Close my eyes 'cause my whip so glossy
God damn, bitch, I don't smoke no gas
I don't pop no Xans, hella cake
I just need that ass, don't worry 'bout no mans
Look at me, look at he, you don't wanna fuck with we
Hit the streets, roll on me, you gon' end up in the sea

We gon' pull up on the kids with a flat brim cap and the tats get the brick
And I don't give a fuck hit em with the damn dicks
Man, hold up, pause, now they red like Santa Claus
I'm a G bet there's something wrong with me
All these mans on the ground, lookin like the dead ass sea
Yeah, pull up on me, sip a high-t, till I OD
I don't really give a fuck no more b
Skrrt skrrt onamonapee, bitch Grand Prix
Pull up on a fuckin enemy, 3rd degree
Now imma go right back to the crib (to the crib bitch)
And leave the fuckin country with the brick (loudpack)

Uh, ayy, yuh
Born in '99 and I got 99 chicks in my crib (ayy, what?)
X got out the Pen, I knew about it from his fuckin' team (ayy)
Only make this shit then when you listen, you gon' fuckin' quit
Not from Florida but they like, "He go hard, he just a jit" (buh, ayy)
On my dick, ayy, why you on my dick?
Swear, last week, you wasn't fuckin' with me
Now you tryna click (ayy)
Wait, bitch, please do not make me wait
I fly over to your state (ayy)
Don't be lyin' like the mothafuckin' cake, uh (ayy)
20/20 vision, still not fuckin' with it
Every move I make, I do with precision
Everybody tryna get on a song
But what is the purpose when I'm not the feature?
Woah, tryna be the GOAT but I just see them walkin' by my door
Make the country proud, I got the governor wearin' all my clothes

Saw a car crash, it remind me of our first date
Then I went back, got massages at that one place
Always brought friends but today I feel like doin' this shit alone
Callin' my dad when I wanna hear some wisdom
Callin' my cab alcohol up in my system
Saw a fist fight and that shit don't even make me scared no more
Man, I never been the one to be alone
All my friends are always hittin' up my phone
Every day is spent with everybody, never on my own
But today I'm by myself and I don't even feel alone
Like to smoke cigs every time I feel the outside
Like to play chicks but get mad when they get new guys
You don't get me but I don't blame you, I don't get myself
Pressin' on keys, got my life so sweet man
GoFundMe on your bitch's pinned tweet man
Bumpin' oldies as I try to dick her down
She said give it to me now, and I can't help but listen
She go, "Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh"
Slippery sign all over my door
Show some attitude and bitch I won't show
Expectation high, I feel like a drone
2018, I got some new goals
Not checkin' my statement 'til I got 4 mill
Rushin' all year like I commit roadkill
Killin' everybody like I'm in a wrong deal
Do triple checks on every move I make
Work 'til I'm tired then sip on some latte
Only do shit if we do it my way
Everything gon' depend on what I say
3, 4

Ayy, hold up, wait a second
Man, my flow on lethal weapon
Hit 'em with the rhymin' pattern
Put these rappers under pressure
This feel like Armageddon
If she witcha I'ma get her
Cut you off like Jerry Heller
She gon' need another fella, ayy
I don't take drugs, I just take naps
Find another girl to eat up like I hate snacks
Dick gon' make her choke like reflux, gotta relax
Man, yo' shit is borin' and it's makin' me go sleep fast
And I always care 'bout everybody but myself
That's the life of a Virgo, never gettin' mad
That's not the Brian that we know
I just weighed my heart, it's about 30 kilos
I just fucked a lady and she 'bout 30 years old
Rappin' on this instrumentals, feelin' like a hero
Never usin' triplet flows because I'm not a Migo
Only lastin' longer 'cause I'm drunk, I don't think she knows
Only thing that matters that my dick is like my ego
They wishin' I'ma fail
These days, no picnics, ain't no fun and games
Still, motherfuckas always got a lot to say
Never got love, so they spreadin' all this hate oh, oh
Man they always actin' real tough
But I show up for a show and they just wanna leave town
People sayin' that my words are colder than the winter
It's Brian, not Brita, so I'll never have a filter

You can't get rid of me, I ain't goin' nowhere
And I'm always multiplyin' like I always fornicate
Cake, cake up on this belt, the day I landed in the States
Doin' one take all day and I'm just spittin' out the mace (mace)
She like sippin' out that mason jar
She a hippie, she gon' suck for some granola bars
Little freaky got me curious like I'm on Mars
Sayin', I forgot my roots, goddamn, you went too far

Damn, make all my own shit, I get all the profits
If you actin' lazy, then do not expect your props, bitch
Movin' with the tactics, got Gildan on my fabrics
Go ham on the mic, just like I'm sitting in the cockpit, ayy
Used to hate the camera, now your boy's a natural
Now your boy is on the road two months and I'ma get the load
Try to put me in a box, I'm gon' always break the lock
Call me D-Wayne, 'cause she licking on my Johnson like The Rock
Oh my God, man, his voice so deep, I thought he was 21 plus
Brian be so clean, wanna let him spank on my bum
He just turned 18, but for him, I'd catch a case, damn (hold up)

27 shows, I go through cities every now and then
I watch the crowd, they jumpin', watchin' me (watchin' me)
Cut, cut to days ago
I'm just a kid not old enough to smoke a cig
They wonder, "What's the recipe?" (ayy, recipe)
They want me to come home
I can hear the drum roll
But understand I'm out here for a reason
Li-livin' in my own home
Father miss me, I know
But also he know that I'm on a mission (mission)

I got diamonds on my fist and shit
Diamonds on my wrist and shit
So icy, bitch, I'm colder than a freezer (bling-blaow)
My main bitch bitchin' (21), side bitch trippin'
Bitch I love ya'll both but none of y'all ain't no keepers
I'll leave ya, Rolls Royce look like Jeepers Creepers (21)
Made a million dollars with Adidas (21)
Can't have a ticket, nigga, off my beeper (21)
Take this shit to trial, nigga, I'm gon' beat it
Spilt my lean, it got me heated
Say it one time, I don't repeat it
Baby, get down on your knees and eat it, (wow) eat it, eat it
Walking out of Louis V with the big box
Yeah I pulled at Saint Laurent, I made a pit stop
Young Savage walk around with the big Glock (21)
With that .30 hangin' out, nigga that's hip-hop (facts)
Car too fast, 12 can't stop me (skrrt)
Bitch too bad, hoes can't fuck me (21)
You was running from the smoke, nigga, not me (on God)
Rich Chigga, 21 Savage, now it's O.D. (21)

She act like a bird
I wear shit made out of fur
Your man say he getting money
Claim that he's entrepreneur
Fast car like Fast & Furious
She throw it back, DeLorean
I'm sittin' in somebody's BMW recordin' this
Not my whip, not my whip
Rather walk or take a Lyft
On a trip, I hit the strip
That made me sad and then I dip
Ayy, Brian learnin' how to live it (damn)
People 'round him go in circles
Head is spinnin' with no fidget (recipe)
Used to play the drums though
Never liked it, no, no
Lil' Brian didn't see the bigger picture
Rap-rap on my own beats so
One hundred percent goes
Straight to my li'l pockets and I keep it

I'll do the shit 'til the credits roll
Already got through the greatest goals
Met with a girl when I went back home (ayy)
She put me in a group chat with that pussy
Talk to it, send emojis to the pussy
Then beat it up 'til it wanna go sue me (ayy)
My brother called me and told me to man up
Told me to be lactose tolerant
Man stop avoidin' that cheddar (ayy)
In love with the Solo cups
I'm on the road and I'm lovin' my bunk
Still missin' home, but I'm havin' my fun, uh
I would never quit, I'm too legit
Indonesian MC Hammer in this bitch
Beat your ass if you correct my grammar in this bitch
I done way too much for you to say my parents' rich (nah)
But I'm tryna make it happen
Makin' green like Geico
All because I'm nice, ho
They know what I like though
Pussy on my rider
Groupies is some psychos
My bedroom is a psych ward
Tell that girl to smile more

Never worry 'bout a single hatin motherfucker
Lookin like my next supper, all these moves that I'm makin got people talkin
Like how many papers is this man signin, I'm back wit the backpack rap

Wanna beat me in my game then bitch I'm settin up camp
When the females hear my name I know they pussy all damp
Mr. Veterinarian I make that kitty go ham (damn)

You got cash, buy sum chains, I buy houses ain't that strange
You ain't shit, I get lit, all you do is counterfeit
Little chick, but she thick, and she always on my drink
Shit I'm thirsty give it back, and she blondy just like Zac
("who the fuck is Zac?" "high school musical")

Checkin on your Instagram I see that shit is going slow, always hating on the progress man yo ass has gotta go

I'm givin' my number to any bitch lookin' like Ronda
I'm Gunner Stahl, I'm takin' many pics
I'm thinkin bout havin' many kids
Even Osama gon' be like, "Goddamn that's a lot of kids"
Hit 'em with a good amount of the hits
I'm thinkin' will I put 'em out of the biz?
Shout to $uicideBoy$, kill ‘em all, rest in piss
Sip on LaCroix on the bus that I missed
Talkin bout somethin' that I never did
I talk to myself, and all my seven chicks
They love to go down just like your relevance
I'm a rapper, but my name isn't Chance
Come to my show, people think I'm intense
Don't look at me, somethin' wrong with your lens
One day the money's gon' be for the Benz
Flow be so dirty, it needed a cleanse
I'm in my zone, I went through this shit alone
Didn't have no friends, talk to myself we always get along
I'm still learnin', I'm still fuckin' up, correct me if I'm wrong
Talkin' business more than usual that means I'm out with Sean (88)
Never yellow in my urinal, I'm always drinkin' on that Pellegrino
I been rockin' my own merch, I'm makin' way more green than CeeLo
I saw people from my school, they all turned out to be some weirdos
I don't need no education, Internet's my favorite teacher

Told that bitch that I don't really give a fuck 'bout you
Told that man that he gotta quit, it ain't cool
Makin' up for the confrontation that I ain't do
As a teen, all the fight I've been in was virtual
Now I'm gettin' old, and my dick is gettin' older
Keep seven bitches on my phone like a folder
When they were 18, man I was a toddler
Damn, homeschool felt like yesterday
I worked at my mom's cafe
Met a girl like every day
It's my only social place
They thought I was from LA
No I'm not, but now I'm here
Tryna fill my parents' plate
They call me up like every day
People say I'm good, they say I get what I should
Tell me not to worry, everything will go real smooth
People think I'm Dory, I'm forgettin bout my hood
Man, should I be sorry for just doin' somethin' new?
Man, these dudes gotta be more quiet than they think
They be hella sure, but I always say amen
Do the shit for the people that look like me
So the girls can see them and they think of me
And not that kid that throw that fit
'Cause he didn't get straight A's all week

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

She said, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there’d be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)

This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
Yeah, and you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad ‘cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring—dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do

I'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox —
No I'm not
Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops
Reptar
Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars
Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock
Harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown
About 5, 7 of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon
I'ma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is tellin' me that she's been gettin' intimate with men (Syd, shut the fuck up)
Here's the number to my therapist (Shit)
You tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time
I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks; that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want – Fuck money, diamonds, and bitches; don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
Damn

They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a Pitchfork
Still suicidal I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' Goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit
Dead

The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic contradicting dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang
See, he did come back though)

To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

Whats up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup?
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'mma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts (fuck)
I love you

Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow
Yeah, that's good

Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Can make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no goddamn meaning
Sorry—I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

C'mon baby
Even though I hate you
I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love (I know)
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him (look)
(Look. I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (Love)

Golden rubbers in these denim pockets
On my waist, there's a black Glock
New girl moved on the block
She been plottin' on my brown cock
Last night I slept over hers
During sex, I overheard
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga, with intentions, that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one
But I give two for us cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn
From Adventurin' Time

Sick to my motherfucking tummy
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco

So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet
(No homo. Too soon.)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

Wait a God damn second
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure

You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Anytime I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like a alcoholic
You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Yeugh!

Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch you, nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Poseurs looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck
(Oh, shut the fuck up!)
(Gunshot)

This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck them

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport, go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses, take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares I caught, go to sleep

I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton, wearing some fucking Heelys

I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug hoy, I’m bad for you kids to listen to
Soy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? (Umm)
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nigga
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I'm calling your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned

Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48", motherfucka I'm great
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike tire
Never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now!"

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch Suck Dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I’m a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I’m badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
Shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me
Up and down, the friction makes a squeaky sound, the shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing like...

Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that ni-guh, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way, way, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone

Well lately baby, I don't give a fuck
I'm sick of kissing up, I used to miss us taking pics and kissing
Now you miss the club, I pull my zipper up
Start to think "Wait, is this it for us?"—Nah
'Cause I fell for you
See I'm the living Icarus, relationships they suck
I'm lookin' around and girl what happened to me?
(What happened? What happened? What happened?)
They hate on me now but soon I'll be winning
And plaque after plaque, you will see it
And they mad at my accuracy
But my swaggy flow can't even rap to the beat
Better pass it to the chief, world is tragic and deceased
Cops selling crack in the street
But you look like the law
I know I broke your heart but I loved you from the start
Baby tell me all your secrets, baby you know this is hard
When I'm crying in your arms, staring at the stars, it's my—

Look, your love's like a river, bae, I've seen better days, yeah
In my soul, you penetrate, I need your energy
Your vibrations make me levitate, sipping Hennessy
Reading bell hooks, she just sayin'

Baby, you are so unusual like cutting cuticles
But that is just what makes you beautiful like watching tulips grow
When you walk, it's just slow motion baby, why you moving slow?
And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, O.M.G, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold
I mean they feed the children dopamine
And leave them on the sofa
I mean, ah, I need someone to renounce with, whoa
Ice bucket challenge in the fountain, whoa
Chance of finding you, one in a hundred thousand, whoa
I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa

She said, "Love is a strong word", said love is a strong word?
Well I'mma sing it for you baby, I'll be your song bird
If we don't have no loving, how we supposed to move onward?
Heard a brother just got shot because he stopped on the wrong curb
If love is a strong word, then love is a strong word
Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move onward
And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your song bird
But I'ma keep it honest with you

Yo, what's going on with the world, momma?
(Where's the love)
Yo, people living like they ain't got no mommas
(Where's the love)
I think they all distracted by the drama and attracted to the trauma, mama
(Where's the love)
I think they don't understand the concept or the meaning of karma
(Where's the love)

Overseas, yeah, they trying to stop terrorism
(Where's the love)
Over here on the streets, the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
(Where's the love)
But if you only got love for your own race
(Where's the love)
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
(Where's the love)

And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man, we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind, just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate to the love
So the whole world celebrate it

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
(Where's the love)
New days are strange, is the world insane?
(Where's the love)
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
(Where's the love)
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
(Where's the love)

Where's the love when a child gets murdered, or a cop gets knocked down?
Black lives, not now
Everybody matter to me, all races
Y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
Everybody hate somebody, guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protest with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart, why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around

Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
(Where's the love)
And if you never speak truth, then you never know how love sounds
(Where's the love)
And if you never know love, then you never know God, wow
(Where's the love)
Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know

My mama asked me why I never vote, never vote
Cause policemen want me dead and gone, dead and gone
That election looking like a joke, such a joke, man
And the weed man still sellin' dope, oh no
Somebody gotta give these niggas hope, give us hope
All he ever wanted was a smoke, my gosh
Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
Layin' on the ground died from a choke

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
(Where's the love)
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
(Where's the love)
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
(Where's the love)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
(Where's the love)

My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues
Like how I ain't notice that? (How I ain't see that?)
Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help
But what you want for some, some niggas
Really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (skrrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awkward
And I heard through some words that you're off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared
Cause y'all throw so much shade
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga

Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself
Than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, "Fuck no," the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga

Batman, Batman, Batman
Joker just put me on acid
Huh, you on the wave like a Maverick
You need to make something happen
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please put me on new fashion
Huh, I ain't learn nothing since last year
You got the renegade fabrics
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please put me up on a Tesla (skrrt!)
I'm tryna be hella extra
Please hand-me-down a new sweatshirt
Batman, Batman, Batman
Heard that you ain't got a mattress
Heard that you king of Manhattan (Queens)
So why you stay in the 'Basas?
Batman, Batman, Batman
We need to settle the scores
Jokers they still want a war
Watch out, I'm closing the doors
Batman, Batman, Batman
I heard you married a Porsche
That shit is all in the past, plus we got very divorced
You ain't ready for the war, Skywalker with the force
1, 2, 3, 4, D'artiste is making noise
In the suburbs with the boys, on a roll, no Royce
Had to save the day every single way, we don't really got a choice
Batman, Batman, Batman
Please save the day from the demons
I was sleep and he was leaning
We drove right into a precinct

Fucking my team for the free, ya
Ayy, ayy, yeah

Fuck bein' humble
Little bitch, I'm from the jungle, ayy (word)
Haters talk down but every time they do
They always fucking mumble (word, word)
Lil nigga, when you talkin' to a boss
Watch how you're talkin' (word)
Cause I got some niggas that pull up right now
And put you in a coffin (blrrt buck bow!)
Yeah, put 'em in a coffin

Contraband, contraband, contraband (contraband)
I got the plug in Oaxaca (woah)
They gonna find you like "blocka" (blaow)

Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hold up

Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she asking "Why you say that?!"
I'm chilling, real nigga feeling
Rich kid, asshole; paint me as a villain
Still spitting that cash flow – DJ Khaled

Real nigga, I rep those, why though? 'cause I said so
Hip deep in the Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo, you faker than some Sweet'N Low
Yeah, you got some silverware but really are you eating though?
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese, your girl, she jocking these
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't copping these, niggas ain't looking like me
Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)

Different color, my passport; Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear, and your girl drank my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair – It's silver spoon coon, ho
Ain't nobody sicker in my Fisker, "vroom-vroom," ho
Ain't nobody—
(Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know)
Top of the holy totem
R-r-r-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods and I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that AKA
White hood, white hood; O-KKK
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
"Err-eh-err-eh", onomatopoeia
Oh, I got my cool on! (tailor-made!)
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name!

Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there’s coke up my asscrack
Move black girls cause, man, fuck it, I’ll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it’s all about the over Es
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird, like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin’s 440
Eatin’ Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin’ in the islands, lookin’ for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I’m callin’ it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
Cause I’m a beast, bitch, "grrr" - Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl: fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now!” Yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin’ kiss my ass: Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain’t that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don’t know, all I know is I’m the best one

You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin’
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I’m from the South, ain’t got no accent, don’t know why
So this rap is child’s play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit: “First of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can’t even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that’s a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Owwww"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin’ with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I’m in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don’t bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I’m screamin’ “What the fuck is up?” like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I’m doin’ this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it: Casey Anthony
These rappers don’t know what to do
Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune
And I’ll give you all of me until there’s nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch

I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'm-a flirt with this new girl
And I'm-a call if it don't work
So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
Cause

It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome--good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke
And light

So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money, then you burn me, then you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that

Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"

Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:

Niggas please be focused - that Bino, you know this
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said: "this my favorite song"
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it's got cursing in it
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you," he want his percentage
'Cause you were like: "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing?
'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too

Alright, Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time
Mass appeal, orange rind, smoke your green, I'm spendin' mine
The beat is witches brew, but beware, this shit is potent
E.E. cummin' on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss, move somethin'
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, swag two button
Yeah, these girls be actin' crazy when they're dancin': Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
Yeah, this beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so it's time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with your girl when we last seen each other
Yeah, you fuckin' with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
Yeah, my dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper, man, you could've fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me, ah

Alright, I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah, I like a white girl, sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though
So it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fuckin' is a sport
Are there Asian girls here? Minority report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse, here's the check, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth, man
I got some pussy that was insane
So insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant, niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit, comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
It's monster shit, you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Yes, your booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed, my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed it, I meant honeys, oh, forget it
I have worked all winter, I will not fail summer
In the back of a bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she let me pollinate
Workin' hard as shit, yeah, this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga, can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second
Man, we eatin', where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry, have this sandwich
Got my wallet, cheese, and lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin'?
Runnin' the Earth, give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it
'Cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough
You get sloppy drunk, I stay whiskey neat
My clique should be cancelled: Freaks and Geeks

I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits till I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me "turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute

All the girlfriends saying "here we go again"
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes...right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try

At a Clippers game on the courtside (side)
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five (five)
They mad at me too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger"
(Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid (nah)
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there? Say some
Girl, say some, no, this ain't a vacation
This is my house, my house, all she needed was some

Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? AK, nigga
When I ball, I'ma ball, King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around
When you wanna play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...
